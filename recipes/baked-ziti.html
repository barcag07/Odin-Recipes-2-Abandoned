        <h3> Description</h3>
        <p>Baked ziti is hearty comfort food in a casserole dish. It's cheesy, meaty, and the right amount of saucy for a dish that the entire family will love. While sometimes it may seem easier to just grab a pre-made baked ziti from the grocery store, we're here to tell you to put that cold pasta dish down! You'll be missing out on all of the wholesome goodness that homemade baked ziti has to offer — and the homemade version is actually easy to make.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The key to this recipe is the sauce and the cheese. Start with a store-bought marinara sauce (yes, it doesn't have to be all homemade) and beef it up by adding some fresh ingredients. Using your favorite store-bought pasta sauce will shorten your cooking time — and truthfully, no one will be able to tell after you add the onions, garlic, ground beef, ground sausage, and spices.
